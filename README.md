## Description

This project implements a quantum-safe cryptography system using adaptive key lengths. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt data based on different threat levels (low, medium, high), simulating the need for more robust encryption in the age of quantum computing. The encryption algorithm adapts dynamically by adjusting the key length based on the perceived level of quantum computing threats.


## Features

- **Adaptive Key Length**: Adjusts the RSA key length based on the threat level (low, medium, high).
- **RSA Encryption/Decryption**: Uses RSA encryption to secure sensitive data, with the ability to modify key strength.
- **Quantum-Safe Simulation**: Simulates quantum-safe encryption by offering adjustable key lengths suitable for future quantum threats.
